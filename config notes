need to export WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1 for mouse cursor

Networking - can refer to Insane Industries page
Need to setup a symlink for resolved
Need to edit some network files for networkd
Need to edit iwd's main.conf file

## For void

Run this to install packages from the list

xbps-install -S $(cat void_linux_pkglist.txt)

Don't Forget the line to change for seatd
If you wanna run river, need to build it yourself
  * Need to install the devel versions of the libraries too
  * Need updated zig as well, so download that manually and put it in the path
For audio, follow this
  * https://github.com/yurifuko/dotfiles/wiki/Guides
    - basically: install pipewire and alsa-pipewire
    - create pipewire config file at /etc/pipewire
    - copy initial config from /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf to /etc/pipewire/
    - edit /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf so the end looks like this:
      ```
      context.exec = [
        { path = "/usr/bin/wireplumber" args = "" }
        { path = "/usr/bin/pipewire" args = "-c pipewire-pulse.conf" }
        ]
      ```
    - then make the alsa conf directory sudo mkdir -p /etc/alsa/conf.d/
    - sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/50-pipewire.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
    - sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
  
For fonts
  * fonts are located at /usr/share/fonts
  * can install nerd-fonts package for void
  * then run sudo fc-cache -fv to make your system know it has new fonts
  * then when actually using the font, use fc-list then use the name after the ".ttf:" to use that particular font

If you delete /var/service (oops) then reinstall runit with -f

## For river

May need some packages like xz, polkit, seatd

curl -O https://ziglang.org/download/0.9.1/zig-linux-x86_64-0.9.1.tar.xz
tar -xvf zig-linux-x86_64-0.9.1.tar.xz
cd zig-linux-x86_64-0.9.1 && ln -s "${PWD}/zig" "${HOME}/.local/bin"
git clone https://github.com/riverwm/river && cd river && git submodule update --init
sudo xbps-install -S wayland-devel wayland-protocols libevdev-devel wlroots-devel scdoc pkg-config xorg-server-xwayland
zig build -Drelease-safe -Dxwayland --prefix ~/.local install

## Setting up spotify_player
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features "pulseaudio-backend lyric-finder media-control image sixel notify"
