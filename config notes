For void
If you wanna run river, need to build it yourself
  * Need to installl the devel versions of the libraries too
  * Need updated zig as well, so download that manually and put it in the path
For audio, follow this
  * https://github.com/yurifuko/dotfiles/wiki/Guides
    - basically: install pipewire and alsa-pipewire
    - create pipewire config file at /etc/pipewire
    - copy initial config from /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf to /etc/pipewire/
    - edit /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf so the end looks like this:
      ```
      context.exec = [
        { path = "/usr/bin/wireplumber" args = "" }
        { path = "/usr/bin/pipewire" args = "-c pipewire-pulse.conf" }
        ]
      ```
    - then make the alsa conf directory sudo mkdir -p /etc/alsa/conf.d/
    - sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/50-pipewire.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
    - sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
  
For fonts
  * fonts are located at /usr/share/fonts
  * can install nerd-fonts package for void
  * then run sudo fc-cache -fv to make your system know it has new fonts
